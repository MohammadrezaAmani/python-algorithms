#Â  Find Leaves of Binary Tree (Medium)

Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

1. Collect all the leaf nodes.
2. Remove all the leaf nodes.
3. Repeat until the tree is empty.

 

### Example 1:

![Find Leaves of Binary Tree](./../../../assets/find_leaves.png)

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since 
per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.

### Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

### Constraints
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
